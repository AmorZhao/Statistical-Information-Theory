error detecting and error correcting codes
by r. w. hamming
1. introduction
he author was"ìed to the studyªgiven in this paper from a consideration of large scale computing machines in which a large number of
operations must be performed without a single error in the end result- this
problem of dÏing things right on a large scale is not essentially new in a
telephone central office, for example, a very large nuiber of operations are
performed w(	le the errors leading to wrong numbers are kept wedl under
control, though they have not been completely eliminated. thkS has been

achieved, in part, through the use of selfchecking circuits. the occasional
failure that escapes routine checking is still detected by the customer and
will, if it persists, result in customer complaint, while if it is transient it will
produce only occasional wrong numbers. at the same time the rest of the
central office functions satisfactorily. in a digital computer, on the other
hand, a single failure usually means the compdete failure, in the sense that
if it is detected no more computing can be done until the failure is located

and corrected, while if it escapes detection then iw invcMidates all subsequent
operations of the machine. pu| in other words, in a telet`one central office
there are a number of parallel paths which are more or L%ss independent of
each other in a digital machine there is usually a single long path which
passes through the same piece of equipment many, many times before tH-
answer is obtained.
in transmitting information from one place to another digital machines
use codes which are simply sets of symbols to which meanings or values are
attached. examples of codes which were designed to detect isolapcd errors
are numerous among them are the highly developed 2 out of 5 codes used
extensively in common control switching systems and in the bell relay


computers, the 3 out of 7 code used for radio telegraphy, and the word
count sent at the end of telegrams.

in some situations self chgCking is not enough. for example, in the model
5 relay computers built by bell telephone laboratories for the aberdeen
proving grounds, observations in the¨early period indicated about two
or three relay failures per day in the 8900 relays of the two computers, representing about one failure per two to three million relay operations. the self

checking feature meant that these failures did not introduce undetected
errors. since the machines were run on an unattended basis over nights and
weekends, however, the errors meant that frequently the computations
came tn a halt althoumh often the machines took up new problems. the
present trend is toward electronic speews in di_ital computers vhere the
basic elements are somewhat more reliablm per operation than relays. however, the incidenc of isolated failures, even ehen detected, may seriously
interfere with the normal use of such machines. thus it appears desirable
to examine the next step beyond error detection, namely esBor correction.
we shall assume that the transmitting equipment handles information
in the binary form of a sequence of 0s and(±s. this assumption is made

both for mathematical convenience and because the binary system is the
natural form for representing the open and closed relays, fl)ðflop cirbUits,
dots and dashes, and
